## üèóÔ∏è Requirements

1. [A Discord Bot Token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
2. [Node.js v16.6 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## üåø Branches

`main` - Most stable builds of the bot, updates endured tests.

`discord.js` - The latest development builds of the bot, it could work or it could not work.
ü§∑ 50/50 chance.

`discord.py` - The latest python version of the bot, since it's been discontinued. It's purpose is an archive.

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration

Run `git clone --branch main https://github.com/PloxHost-LLC/community-bot` then cd `community-bot` to access your project directory. Replace main with another branch is preferred.

Copy/rename `.env.template` to `.env` and fill out the values:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit or share your token or API keys publicly ‚ö†Ô∏è

```env
token = token
prefix = ?
guildId = main_guild_id
clientId = bot_id
POSTGRES_host="localhost"
POSTGRES_port=5432
POSTGRES_DATABASE="database"
POSTGRES_USER="username"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="password"
POSTGRES_ROOT_PASSWORD="password"
themeColor = "#39b5af"
brandName = "Ploxy"
```

**Step 1:** Replace `token` with your bot token such as `eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.dozjgNryP4J3jVmNHl0w5N_XgL0n3I9PlFUP0THsR8U`. After doing so, you will end up with `token = eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0.dozjgNryP4J3jVmNHl0w5N_XgL0n3I9PlFUP0THsR8U`. **This is not your token**, to get one please follow this [guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).

**Step 2:** Decide on a prefix for administrative commands such as changing bot features. All public-facing features use [slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ).

**Step 3:** Get your test guild's id to publish guild specific commands for testing. The guild id can be obtained by following this [guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).

**Step 4:** Decide on Postgres details. If using Discord Bot hosting offered by PloxHost, please navigate to your bot -> Databases -> Click on your database or create one(pick any name) **At the time of writing, this is not supported**. If you

- `POSTGRES_HOST` is the endpoint, whether it is a Domain or an IP address. If you are using a localhost database put `172.0.0.1` or `localhost`. If you are using docker-compose use `postgres` as the `POSTGRES_HOST`

- `POSTGRES_PORT` is thePOSTGRES/MariaDB port. The default is `3306`, if using docker-compose please leave this alone.

- `POSTGRES_USER` is thePOSTGRES/MariaDB username you want to use. On PloxHost's panel, it is the long name on the right side of the database. Place this in quotations to avoid any issues.

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is thePOSTGRES/MariaDB password you want to use. On PloxHost's panel, it's the eye next to the garbage bin emoji, press the eye and scroll down till you see the password field.

- `POSTGRES_DATABASE` is thePOSTGRES/MariaDB database name you want to use. On PloxHost's panel, it's the large text on the left side. Make sure the user has the correction permissions to access the database.

**Step 5:** Setup brand information for your bot.

- `themeColor` is the embed colour theme to use. This can be any hex string that you want to use. You could use the help of a colour wheel or use your brand [colour](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/).

- `brandName` is what will show up on the bottom of embeds. You could use the name of your brand or bot.
